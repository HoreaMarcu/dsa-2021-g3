# Lab 02

lab 02: I have installed Git, learned how to use the GitHub platform and how to use them together to submit my work.
SSL-> studied in depth the resources and managed to work with SSL, first by examining the code snippets and then by working on problems.
worked first on the extra problmen because it seemed pretty straightforward (SSL operations presented in pdfs)

submitted the first problem.
lab02_problem 1: for the functions i used mainly the ideas from the lab resources
		the "garage" is basically a stack, so i implemented the push and pop operations on it
		stored 	"road" as a normal SSL
		file names in main arguments
		struggled a bit in reading the instructions correclty
		question: should we pay attention to the warning regarding the pointers (if we have a header cell and our pointer is of type "header cell" at first but it points afterwords to a "node"(head->first->next))?
		i mean it could cause errors? program worked fine.
